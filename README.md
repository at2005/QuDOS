# BTYSTE-2022-Project
An OS kernel for managing hybrid classical/quantum communication through shared memory buffers, alongside a custom systems programming language (Q++)

Q++ compiler translates quantum gates into special system calls. The language also supports asynchronous execution while waiting on the QPU, and allows sections of the program to run on the classical QPU-driver, removing the need to transfer data between client and server for conditional processing. Everything is simulated for now.
